The current directory contains graffer useful set of scripts.
They are grouped by distribution name because I am not sure 
that all of them will work correct on different operating system.
The following scripts are just example how graffer can be used to
collect data and it is not necessary to use them. 
Everybody is welcome to add or edit scripts for his own needs.

Configuration:

	# sh setup.sh

	Setup.sh will create compaths.conf file into the same directory.
	It will contains PATHs of the command line programs which will be
	used from the scripts.
	Every script will load compaths.conf and will use described PATHs
	for the program.

How to use:

	# ./freebsd/netstat.sh sis0 in
	36664396

	This command will return incoming traffic for network interface sis0
	If compaths.conf is missing or parameters to netstat.sh are incorrect
	it will return 0. For correct script syntax please check the current
	script source.

The scripts collection is useful but you can use any other external program
to collect the necessary information. For example: http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/.
